A simple web adaptation of the puzzle game [Mahjong solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong_solitaire) that does not use any custom images or fonts, instead utilizing the [Mahjong Tiles Unicode block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong_Tiles_(Unicode_block)) with system fonts.

A solo project developed not only for personal play, but to explore the concept of playable Unicode game pieces, the inner-workings of proper board generation and logic of multiple variations of Mahjong solitaire, and use of the React framework (including switching from components to hooks and switching from CRA to Vite).

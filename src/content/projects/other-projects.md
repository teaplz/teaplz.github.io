Here are some of my attempted private projects:

* **Apr 2021 - Sep 2021** - A second attempt at the 2019 web application project, this time focusing on collaborating for multi-user narratives (such as tabletop roleplaying games). Focused more on starting with a RESTful API, documented with OpenAPI/Swagger. Also attempted to bring it over to C# as a .NET 7 project in 2023, without much success.

* **May 2019 - Oct 2019** - A Spring Boot web application for friends to create customizable profiles of their fictional characters for narrative-based games and stories. Developed to get better re-acquainted with Java, the Spring framework, and modern MVC conventions of the time. Includes a user authentication system with both role-based administration and invitation tokens, image uploading with proper thumbnailing, and front-end pages using Bootstrap for layouts and AngularJS for AJAX updates. Also tested deployment and integration with AWS.

* Some failed game development and retrocomputing projects throughout the 2010's, not worth talking about.

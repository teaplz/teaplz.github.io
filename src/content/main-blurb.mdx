Hey there, I'm **Tyler**! Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm just some guy in his late-30's with a background in software engineering and passions in application development, retro video game development, and retrocomputing in general.

At the moment, I don't have much of a social media presence nor an enthralling portfolio of public projects, but I hope you find something in this website that interests you!

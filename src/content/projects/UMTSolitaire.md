A simple web adaptation of the puzzle game [Mahjong solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong_solitaire) that does not use any custom images or fonts, instead utilizing the [Mahjong Tiles Unicode block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong_Tiles_(Unicode_block)) with system fonts.

A solo project developed not only for personal play, but to explore the concept of playable Unicode game pieces, the inner-workings of both proper board generation and game logic of multiple variations of Mahjong solitaire, and the use of the React framework (including the switch from class to functional components and migrating from CRA to Vite for testing and deployment).

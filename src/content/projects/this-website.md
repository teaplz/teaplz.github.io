The website you are currently looking at! 😉

A simple Astro website for putting my projects, links, and blog posts. Designed the layout from scratch, using the fonts [Monda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Monda) (overall), [Tomorrow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tomorrow) (main header), and [Genos](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Genos) (banner).
